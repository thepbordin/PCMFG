Chapter 1: The Meeting

Elizabeth stood at the edge of the ballroom, her heart heavy with dread.
She had no desire to be here, among these proud, wealthy strangers.

And then she saw him. Mr. Darcy stood across the room, his expression cold
and haughty. Their eyes met briefly, and she felt a flash of irritation
at his obvious disdain.

"He is the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world," she declared
to her friend Charlotte later that evening. "I could never like him."

Chapter 2: The Revelation

Weeks passed, and Elizabeth's opinion of Mr. Darcy only worsened. But then
came the letter—the letter that changed everything.

As she read his careful explanation, her heart began to race. She had been
so wrong. So terribly, horribly wrong about him.

"I have been blind," she whispered to herself, tears forming in her eyes.
"Blind to his true character."

For the first time, she felt something other than dislike for the proud
Mr. Darcy. She felt curiosity. And perhaps, just perhaps, the slightest
stirring of something more.

Chapter 3: The Resolution

When they met again at Pemberley, Elizabeth could barely contain her
emotions. He was different now—warmer, more open. And he looked at her
with such tenderness that her heart melted.

"Miss Bennet," he said softly, "I am glad to see you again."

She smiled, feeling a joy she had never known before. "And I you, Mr. Darcy."

She hated him with every fiber of her being. Every word he spoke
cut her like a knife. She wanted to scream, to rage, to destroy him.

But at the same time, she couldn't stop thinking about him. His face
haunted her dreams. His touch—even in memory—sent shivers down her spine.

"I loathe you," she hissed, even as her body betrayed her, leaning
toward him of its own accord. "I loathe everything about you."

"And yet," he replied with a dangerous smile, "here you are."
